### 1. How do you set up a local Python dev environment?  
- What IDE do you use?
- How do you set up a Python production environment in Linux?
- List the CLI commands if possible.


Here are the general steps for setting up a local Python development environment and a Python production environment on Linux involves:

1. What IDE do you use: Several options are available for Python development, and my popular choice is Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It offers a range of features and extensions for an enhanced coding experience.
2. How do you set up a Python production environment in Linux:
   - Check if Python is already installed by running `python --version` or `python3 --version`. If not, install Python using the package manager specific to the Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install python3
     ```
   - Install pip: Pip is the package installer for Python. Install pip by running:
     ```
     sudo apt install python3-pip
     ```
   - Create a Virtual Environment: Virtual environments provide an isolated Python environment for your projects. To create a virtual environment, run:
     ```
     python3 -m venv myenv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment using:
     ```
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages for your project using pip. You can specify the packages in a `requirements.txt` file and install them using:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Set up your project: Create the necessary directory structure for your project and start building your application.

### 2. Are you familiar with using any Linux distro?
- crontab
- ssh
- nfs
- nginx



Yes, I am familiar with Linux and some of its common components. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. crontab:
   - crontab is a Linux command used to schedule and automate recurring tasks or jobs.
   - It allows you to create, edit, and manage cron jobs, which are scheduled commands or scripts that run at specified intervals or times.
   - Crontab can be used to schedule tasks such as backups, log rotations, data synchronization, and periodic scripts.
   - Crontab can be edited using `crontab -e`.

2. ssh (Secure Shell):
   - ssh is a secure protocol that provides encrypted communication between two networked devices.
   - It allows users to securely log into remote systems over an unsecured network and execute commands or transfer files.
   - With ssh, you can establish a secure remote connection to a Linux server or any device that supports ssh.
   - To connect to a remote server using ssh, you can use the command `ssh username@hostname`.

3. nfs (Network File System):
   - nfs is a distributed file system protocol that allows you to share files and directories across a network.
   - It enables remote systems to access and mount shared directories as if they were local file systems.
   - nfs is commonly used in Linux environments for centralized file storage and sharing.
   - To mount an nfs share on a client machine, you can use the `mount` command with the appropriate options and the nfs server's IP address or hostname.

4. nginx:
   - nginx is a popular open-source web server and reverse proxy server.
   - It is known for its high performance, scalability, and efficient handling of concurrent connections.
   - nginx is often used as a front-end web server, load balancer, or reverse proxy to distribute incoming web traffic to backend servers.
   - It can also be used for serving static files, handling SSL/TLS encryption, and caching.
   - To start, stop, or reload the nginx server, you can use commands such as `sudo service nginx start`, `sudo service nginx stop`, or `sudo service nginx reload`.
